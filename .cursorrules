# FlowForce Education - Cursor Rules

## Always Include These Files in Context

When working on this project, always include the following files in your context to understand the project structure and requirements:

1. **agents.md** - Contains detailed project context, business requirements, tech stack details, and agent responsibilities
2. **README.md** (root) - Project overview and links to component documentation  
3. **frontend/README.md** - Frontend setup and development instructions
4. **backend/README.md** - Backend setup and development instructions

## Project Context

This is FlowForce Education, an AI-driven assessment platform that:
- Measures learner mastery at fine-grained levels (per learning objective)
- Provides adaptive, personalized assessments
- Integrates with existing LMS systems via LTI, SCORM, and xAPI
- Uses Django + React + PostgreSQL architecture
- Focuses on privacy with pseudonymized data and multi-tenant architecture

## Key Principles

- Everything must be traceable to a learning objective
- Personalization is per learner
- Respect privacy by design
- Prepare for external LMS embedding
- Optimize for instructor time savings
- Minimize complexity - prefer built-in functionality over custom logic

## Repository Structure

- `frontend/` - React application (student/teacher UI, quiz interface, dashboards)
- `backend/` - Django project (Python, Django REST Framework)
- PostgreSQL database (SQLite can be used for local development)
- Multi-tenant architecture with data isolation

Always refer to the agents.md file for comprehensive project context and requirements.
